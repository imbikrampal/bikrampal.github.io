Hello there! I'm Bikram, an undergrad student at [IISER Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/) pursuing an integrated BS-MS majoring Physics with a minor in Mathematics. This website is my personal space to share my academic adventures, research interests, and even some fun extracurricular pursuits. 


I have a deep-rooted passion for mathematics and its myriad applications in physical systems with disorder. My research interests broadly include non-equlibrium statistical physics, many-body systems with high degree of freedoms, hyperuniformity, chaos and turbulence in Navier-Stokes equation. Apart from this I also take interests in pure mathematics namely problems in Banach and Hilbert Spaces. I've been fortunate to engage in research under the guidance of eminent scientists at institutions like ICTS-TIFR, TIFR-CAM and IIT Kharagpur.

Beyond academics, I wear a few other hats. I’m a passionate football enthusiast and an unapologetic FC Barcelona fan. Music is another constant in my life—I’m an amateur flute player with a deep love for soulful Bengali melodies and timeless Bollywood classics, especially the voice of Rahat Fateh Ali Khan. I also enjoy debating and never miss a chance for a good conversation.When I’m not immersed in mathematics or music, you’ll probably find me chasing good food. I'm a proud foodie with a particular weakness for *rosogolla*. If you ever want to talk math over a plate of something delicious, I’m all ears.

This website is a work in progress. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out—whether it’s for a collaboration, a chat, or just to say hello.
