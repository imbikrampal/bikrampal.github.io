I’m Bikram, a third-year BS-MS student at Department of Physical Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata majoring Physics and minoring Mathematics. My interests span non-equilibrium statistical physics—exploring many-body dynamics, hyperuniformity, and transport in disordered systems with self-organized criticality—to the phenomenology of turbulence and intermittency in Navier–Stokes flows. As an NIUS Scholar (Batch of 2024), I had the opportunity to pursue research at ICTS-TIFR Bangalore under the guidance of [Prof. Samriddhi Sankar Ray](https://www.icts.res.in/people/samriddhi-sankar-ray) and [Prof. Deepak Dhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepak_Dhar). I also worked on computational stochastic processes at IIT Kharagpur and deepened my understanding of multivariable calculus and measure theory at TIFR-CAM Bangalore. 

Off the clock, I’m an FC Barcelona devotee and amateur flautist, a devoted rosogolla hunter, and a fiend for spirited debates—whether about football, philosophy, or the quirkiest integrals. I regularly update this site with notes from my undergraduate courses, which you’re welcome to explore.
