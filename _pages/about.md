Hello there! I'm Bikram, an undergrad student at [IISER Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/) pursuing an integrated BS-MS in Physics. This website is my personal space to share my academic adventures, research projects, and even some fun extracurricular pursuits. 


I have a deep-rooted passion for mathematics and its myriad applications. In the upcomming summer, I will be studying Integration and Measure theory(a geometric approach) from Dr. Debabrata Karmakar at Centre for Applicable Mathematics-Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bengaluru. Currently, my research is focused on turbulence and non-linear partial differential equations, inspired by my work on the Navier-Stokes equations under the guidance of [Dr. Samriddhi Sankar Ray](https://www.icts.res.in/people/ssray) at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences in Bengaluru. I am also trying to understand fractional calculus and solitons under the guidance of [Dr. Uttam Ghosh](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=hfd7_kUAAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of Calcutta. My previous explorations in *Computational Stochastic Processes* at IIT Kharagpur under [Dr. Buddhananda Banerjee](https://sites.google.com/site/buddhanandastat/) have also enriched my understanding in probability theory, markov processes and computational techniques. Apart from this, I also like abstract algebra and number theory.


While my academic life keeps me busy, I’m also a full-time self-proclaimed Football Pundit and a huge fan of FC Barcelona. I’m an enthusiastic Flute Player and an avid Debater. I have a deep appreciation for music, with a taste that revolves around soulful Bengali songs and Bollywood classics—especially the mesmerizing voice of Rahat Fateh Ali Khan. Besides mathematics and music, I am a foodie at heart! I take immense joy in exploring different cuisines, but nothing beats the delight of indulging in a plate full of *rosogolla*. If you ever want to have a conversation about math over some good food, I’m always up for it!


This website is a living document of my ongoing journey. Just as research is never truly complete, this site is always under construction. I invite you to join me as I explore new challenges, share discoveries, and continuously evolve both academically and personally.

Enjoy your visit, and feel free to reach out for collaborations or a friendly chat!
