## Statistical Physics 
My research lies at the intersection of statistical physics and complex systems, focusing primarily on phase transitions, critical phenomena, and transport properties in disordered media.

###### Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena

I study phase transitions from both theoretical and computational perspectives, exploring universal scaling laws and critical exponents that characterize continuous transitions. This includes classical models such as the Ising model(Metropolis, Wolff cluster algorithms) and percolation, as well as more complex systems exhibiting critical phenomena informed by the renormalization group framework and finite-size scaling analysis. (Following foundational approaches by Fisher (Rev. Mod. Phys. 1974) and Binder (Rep. Prog. Phys. 1987))

*Figure: A snapshot of a two-dimensional Ising model on a lattice of size L=256. Each site represents a spin that can take values +1 (black dots) or -1 (white dots). The system temperature* $T$ *controls the spin configuration, and at the critical temperature* $T_c \approx 2.269$, *clusters of all sizes appear, signaling a continuous phase transition. This classical model was exactly solved by Onsager in 1944, providing a cornerstone result in statistical physics.*

From left to right: (1) Average energy per spin $E$, (2) Magnetization $M$, (3) Specific heat $C_v$, and (4) Magnetic susceptibility $\chi$. The sharp changes and peaks near the critical temperature $T_c \approx 2.269$ signal the continuous phase transition from a magnetically ordered to disordered phase, consistent with Onsagerâ€™s exact solution. The results were obtained from Monte Carlo simulations with lattice size $L=32$, demonstrating critical phenomena typical of second-order phase transitions in statistical physics*


###### Percolation Theory and Random Resistor Networks

Percolation theory serves as a fundamental model for understanding connectivity in disordered systems. I investigate geometric and transport properties near the percolation threshold, including cluster statistics and scaling laws (Stauffer & Aharony, *Introduction to Percolation Theory*, 1994). My studies extend to random resistor networks, where I analyze effective conductivity and transport exponents, addressing questions relevant to materials science and porous media. Currently I am studying transport properties on special lattices which are away from percolation threshold and have hyperuniformity. Hyperuniformity describes a class of disordered systems with suppressed density fluctuations at large scales, a topic of growing interest due to its implications for novel material properties and wave propagation control (Torquato & Stillinger, Phys. Rev. E, 2003). My research explores the structural characterization and classification of hyperuniform states, and their potential realizations in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems.

The color scales highlight the spatial heterogeneity and frequency-dependent features emerging from the randomness of the resistor network.*
