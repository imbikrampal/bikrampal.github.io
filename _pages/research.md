## A. Statistical Physics

My research in statistical physics explores emergent phenomena in disordered systems, with a focus on critical phenomena, percolation, and transport in random media. At the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR), under Prof. Deepak Dhar, I study random resistor networks (RRNs) to understand how macroscopic transport arises from microscopic disorder. Currently, I investigate how the variance of conductance scales with system size, connecting to universal fluctuation phenomena. I also explore the effect of hyperuniform disorder, which suppresses long-wavelength fluctuations, and extend these ideas to vibrational properties, drawing parallels between current fluctuations and phonon modes in amorphous solids. This contributes modestly to understanding universality in disordered systems.

## B. Turbulence and Fluid Dynamics

I also study turbulence and fluid dynamics with Prof. Samriddhi Sankar Ray (ICTS-TIFR). Turbulence is inherently complex, and I focus on shell models and Navier–Stokes–Voigt regularization as well as Euler Voigt regularization to understand energy cascades and intermittency. Using models like SABRA and GOY, I examine how regularization affects scaling and intermittency corrections, complementing phenomenological ideas such as the multifractal model. This work connects mathematical regularization with physical features of turbulence and may inform studies of geophysical flows and two-dimensional turbulence in the future to my level of understanding.
