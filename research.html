<h1>Research</h1>

    <p>
      My research interest is broadly equilibrium and non-equilibrium
      statistical physics to understand the physics of complex systems
      that spans from the phenomenology of turbulence to critical
      phenomena and phase transitions in complex environments. In the following, a brief description of the projects are given.

<h3>Entropy of ordered nematic phase in hard rods on lattice</h3>
<div class="research-block">
  <div class="research-text">
    <p>
      Systems of hard rods have been of interest for a long time.
      This problem was first studied by Lars Onsager, who provided
      an exact calculation and argued for a phase transition at
      higher density from a disordered to a nematically ordered
      phase. Later, in 2007, Ghosh and Dhar (EPL) provided numerical
      Monte Carlo evidence showing the existence of another
      transition at high density, where the nematic order is broken
      and a high-density disordered (HDD) phase appears. In 2022,
      Shah <em>et al.</em> argued for the instability of the nematic
      phase and provided an understanding of why the second
      transition (observed only for <em>k &gt; 6</em>) is entropy-driven.
      Similar models have also been studied on lattices such as the
      kagome lattice, which is of interest here.

<h3>Ranked percolation on 2D fractional Brownian surfaces</h3>

      We study percolation on two-dimensional fractional Brownian(fBm) surfaces with different Hurst exponents. Our interest lies in the critical behaviour of this discontinuous phase transition as a function of the Hurst exponent <em>H</em>. In particular, we focus on the limit <em>H → 0</em>. We employ a universal gap-scaling approach to analyse the transition and its characteristics, following ideas developed in <em>Universal Gap Scaling in Percolation</em>(Fan, Meng, Liu &amp; Saberi, <em>Nat. Phys.</em> 16, 455–461, 2020).

<h3>Voigt model of turbulence: a shell model study</h3>
<div class="research-block">
  <div class="research-text">
    <p>
      Just like the regularity problem of the Navier–Stokes equations
      (for which the Clay Institute has a million dollars waiting),
      the regularity of the Voigt model of turbulence is also a
      well-posed mathematical problem (Oskolkov, 1973). There has been significant mathematical development of this
      model (Titi et al. 2006; Kalantarov et al. 2009).
      In this work, we study the Voigt model using a shell-model
      formulation to explore the high–Reynolds-number regime.
      Our focus is on the scaling behaviour of second-order
      structure functions (energy spectra) and dynamical scaling
      exponents. These behaviours are analysed in
      <em>Pal, Kankaria &amp; Ray</em> (in preparation).

<h3>Conduction fluctuation in random resistor networks</h3>

    <p>
      Random resistor networks have been widely studied in the past.
      In the 1970s, much of the interest focused on the percolation
      threshold, with several works discussing scaling theory near
      the critical point <em>p<sub>c</sub></em>. In the 1990s, it was
      realised that the current distribution near criticality in the
      bonds of the network is broad and cannot be characterised by a
      single exponent; instead, a multifractal description was proposed.
      The present study does not focus on criticality itself, but rather
      investigates conductance fluctuations away from the critical. The results are reported in
      <em>B. Pal</em>, <em>Conduction fluctuations in random resistor
      networks with hyperuniform disorder</em> (under review).
